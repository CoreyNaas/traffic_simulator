For the second part of the assignment to further enhance the Traffic Light Simulator, the following features and functionalities can be considered:

1. **Advanced Traffic Flow Management:**
   Integrate a traffic flow management system that uses sensors or a simulated sensor input to dynamically adjust the light cycles based on real-time traffic conditions. This could help reduce congestion during peak hours by allocating longer green lights to the busier roads.

   *Reasoning:* This simulates adaptive traffic control systems used in smart cities, providing a more realistic and efficient traffic management experience.

2. **Emergency Vehicle Priority:**
   Implement a priority system for emergency vehicles, where the traffic lights can change to green for an approaching emergency vehicle, overriding the normal cycle.

   *Reasoning:* This feature reflects real-world scenarios where traffic signals are integrated with emergency response systems, demonstrating the importance of such features for public safety.

3. **Pedestrian Crosswalks:**
   Add pedestrian signals with their own state machine logic that interacts with the vehicle traffic light states, ensuring pedestrians can safely cross the street.

   *Reasoning:* This feature teaches the importance of non-vehicular traffic considerations in traffic signal design and introduces additional complexity in synchronization of different types of traffic.

4. **Turn Lanes with Dedicated Signals:**
   Though the original assignment excludes turn lanes, adding dedicated turn lanes with arrow signals can make the simulator more comprehensive.

   *Reasoning:* Turn lanes are a common feature in intersections that significantly affect the flow of traffic. Understanding how to synchronize turn signals with the main lights is crucial for a complete intersection model.

5. **Data Analytics Module:**
   Develop a module that collects data on traffic light states, frequency of changes, and simulated traffic flow, presenting it through a dashboard in the UI.

   *Reasoning:* This module would provide insight into the efficiency of the traffic light system, allowing for analysis and optimization, which mirrors real-world traffic management systems that rely heavily on data analytics for improvement.

Each of these features would add a layer of complexity and realism to the simulator, offering a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in traffic management systems.
